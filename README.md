## AllActivity React Full-Stack Code Challenge
This coding challenge is an optional, but welcome part of the interview process for a Full-Stack Software Developer position at [AllActivity](https://www.allactivity.com), a remote-first IT startup based in Vienna, Austria.

The coding challenge is meant for candidates to show their problem-solving abilities and demonstrate their development skills. The goal is to give us a good overview of your fullstack skills to build an MVP. There is no need to make it particularly fancy or polished. The reference net development time estimate is four hours.

### Requirements
Build a small web application to record time logs. In order to enter a log entry there should be an input form where you can submit a log entry. Each log entry must have a start datetime, end datetime and a description.

The values must be stored in a SQL database, which should be provided as part of the solution.

On another page the log entries stored in the database must be shown sorted by the start datetime.
Please use the following technologies:
+ React
+ Node
+ SQL database of your choice

### Delivery
The recommended delivery format (including the database) is Docker or another container runtime.

Please publish your changes in a Git repository (feel free to fork this!) so we can evaluate the code and prepare for the interview. Include all code and any instructions needed build/run it. Code quality will be key metrics for evaluation.
